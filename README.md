# RPG-CSharp (WARNING STRONG LANGUAGE)
This is still in the works but it is a C# console RPG/Escape Room game that I worked on over about 3 weeks when I had spare time. I am still in the middle of writing the story and it is a bit graphic.

The intro gives a bit of a story but is ultimately used to get the character name input.
